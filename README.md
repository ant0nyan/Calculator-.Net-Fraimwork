Project: Calculator Application in C#

I developed a calculator application using C# and the .NET framework to enhance my programming skills. The application performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and features a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Key functionalities include:

Input Handling: Users can input numbers and select operations effortlessly.
Error Handling: The application addresses exceptions, such as division by zero, to provide a smooth user experience.
Clear Function: Users can reset the calculator at any time to start a new calculation.
This project significantly improved my understanding of C# and the .NET framework, as well as my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and user interface design.
